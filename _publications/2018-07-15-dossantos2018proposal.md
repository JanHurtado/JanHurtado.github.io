### Abstract

Evolutions in image-scanning technology have led to vast improvements in the fetal assessment. Ultrasound (US) is the main technology for fetal evaluation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally used when US cannot provide high-quality images. This paper presents an interactive bidirectional actuated human-machine interface proposal developed by the combination of a haptic device system (force-feedback technology) and a non-invasive medical image technology.
